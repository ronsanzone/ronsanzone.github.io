I've decided to start a simple blog as a way to document the various projects that I work on. The blog is hosted on github-pages and build with the jekyll framework. This allows quick and painless deployment of a static page site to github for free hosting. In the future, I plan on re-styling this blog using Twitter Bootstrap version 3. For now, however, the blog will use the default styling provided by the jekyll framework.
